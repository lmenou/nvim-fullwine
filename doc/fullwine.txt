*fullwine* - *nvim-fullwine*

This is a colorscheme entirely written in lua, inspired from the colors of
wine.

To use the colorscheme on a day to day basis, it is very simple, at the end of
your |init.vim|, write:
>
    colorscheme fullwine
<
But if you are already full lua, then at the end of your |init.lua|. write:
>
    require.('fullwine').colorscheme()

*g:fullwine_italicize* 
*vim.g.fullwine_italicize* 

By default, some pieces of the colorscheme are italicized, namely, the
|statusline|, the |wilmenu|, the completion selection in popup menu and the
comments in the code. Set to 0 to suppress italics.

- vimL (|init.vim|)
>
    let g:fullwine_italicize = 1
<
- lua (|init.lua|)
>
    vim.g.fullwine_italicize = 1
<
*g:fullwine_plugin_hi_group*
*vim.g.fullwine_plugin_hi_group*

The colorscheme is supported by tree-sitter, set this value to 0 to supress
tree-sitter support.

    let g:fullwine_plugin_hi_group = 1
