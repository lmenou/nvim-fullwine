*fullwine* - *nvim-fullwine*

This is a colorscheme entirely written in lua, inspired from the colors of
Bacchus, autumn and wine.

To use the colorscheme on a day to day basis, it is very simple, at the end of
your |init.vim|, write:
>
    colorscheme fullwine
<
But if you are already full lua, then at the end of your |init.lua|. write:
>
    require('fullwine').colorscheme()
<

There exists a soft and a hard version of the fullwine colorscheme. To use or
try them, replace `fullwine` by respectively `fullwine_soft` and
`fullwine_hard` in the commands specified above. Simple, isn't it ?

*g:fullwine_italicize* 
*vim.g.fullwine_italicize* 

By default, some pieces of the colorscheme are italicized, namely, the
|statusline|, the |wilmenu|, the completion selection in popup menu and the
comments in the code. Set the following value to 0 to suppress italics.

- vimL (|init.vim|)
>
	let g:fullwine_italicize = 1
<
- lua (|init.lua|)
>
	vim.g.fullwine_italicize = 1
<
*g:fullwine_treesitter_support*
*vim.g.fullwine_treesitter_support*

The colorscheme is supported by tree-sitter, set the following value to 0 to
supress tree-sitter support.

- vimL (|init.vim|)
>
	let g:fullwine_treesitter_support = 1
<
- lua (|init.lua|)
>
	vim.g.fullwine_treesitter_support = 1
<

*g:fullwine_plugin_hi_group*
*vim.g.fullwine_plugin_hi_group*

The colorscheme supports some various and famous plugins, this is not enabled
by default, you should turn on the supports explicitely by setting the latter
value to 1. Please, note that this might lead to problems when switching
colorschemes.

	let g:fullwine_plugin_hi_group = 1

	vim.g.fullwine_plugin_hi_group = 1
